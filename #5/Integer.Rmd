## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(lpSolveAPI)



## create IP object
apm.ip <- make.lp(nrow = 9, ncol = 12) # nrow is the number of nodes, ncol is the numnber of arcs
lp.control(apm.ip, sense="max")  #max condition
# create names for nodes and arcs
##
               ## 5     3      3    2      4    4      1     2     6     5     4     7
arc.names <- c ( "x12","x13","x35","x25","x24","x47","x46","x58","x57","x69","x79","x89")       
node.names <- c("node1", "node2", "node3", "node4", "node5", "node6","node7", "node8", "node9")#"node10", "node11", "node12")

# rename the IP object
rownames(apm.ip) <- node.names
colnames(apm.ip) <- arc.names

## obj function
activity <- c(5,3,3,2,4,4,1,2,6,5,4,7)
set.objfn(apm.ip, activity )  #]

## set constraints LHS
set.row(apm.ip, 1, c(1, 1), indices = c(1, 2) )     # node 1 (starting node)
set.row(apm.ip, 2, c(1, -1 ,-1), indices = c(1,4,5))   # node 2 (intermediate node)
set.row(apm.ip, 3,c(1,-1), indices = c(2, 3) )     # node 3(intermediate node)
set.row(apm.ip, 4, c(1, 1, -1, -1), indices = c(4, 3, 9, 8))  # node 4 (intermediate node)
set.row(apm.ip, 5, c(1, -1 ,-1), indices = c(5,6,7))   # node 5 (intermediate node)
set.row(apm.ip, 6,c(1,-1), indices = c(7,10) )     # node 6(intermediate node)
set.row(apm.ip, 7, c(1, 1 ,-1), indices = c(6,9,11))  # node 7 (intermediate node
set.row(apm.ip, 8,c(1,-1), indices = c(8,12) )     # node 8(starting node)
set.row(apm.ip, 9, c(1, 1, 1), indices = c(10,11,12)) #node 9  (ending node)

## set constraints type
set.constr.type(apm.ip, rep("="), 9)

## set constraint RHS
rhs <- c(1, rep(0, 7), 1)
set.rhs(apm.ip, rhs)

## set all variables type to be binary
set.type(apm.ip, 1:12, "binary")

## solve the IP problem
solve(apm.ip)
get.objective(apm.ip)
get.variables(apm.ip)

# put optimal values beside of variable names for better understanding of th results
cbind(arc.names, get.variables(apm.ip))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
